Hi, my name is Lee. I am 19 years old and currently on my first year towards a Bachelor of IT. 
I am currently learning a variety of languages, such as HTML, CSS, JS, SQL and using programs such as DBeaver for SQL, VS Code for coding etc.
Additionally from this, I have experience in using Blender for 3D modelling and animation, alongside using Unity to create 2D (or 3D) games.
