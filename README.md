Hey, I'm Lee, 19, studying my second year of Bachelor of IT. 	
	
I'm learning HTML, CSS, JS, C#, SQL, and using tools like DBeaver, Visual Studio 2022, and Visual Studio Code. 

Alongside this, I am into 3D modeling with Blender and Nomad, and game development with Unity, Unreal Engine, and Blueprint.
